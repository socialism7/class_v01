Research is a specific study method for analyzing problems. Class Analysis is one of the research methods that uses the perspective of social relations dimensions. Today, class analysis has various methods based on contextualization of regional development. So that social relations are not only understood as the relationship between one human being and another, but also more about the relationship between humans and the means of production that support their position in social class. Variables that arise from the relationship are variables in class determination.
Basic income and basic needs are some of the variables that have flexibility, they have consistency in determining class categories. The implementation of class analysis methods using these variables has the purpose of maximizing research work. That is to optimize data management and data processing. Data processing is done by determining the material value of an object (R). Class qualifications are determined using a threshold (λ). In this study used 2 (two) thresholds. If the value of R is greater than the same as the value of the first λ and is smaller than the value of the second λ, information is obtained as a middle class category. Then, if the value of R is smaller than the first λ, it belongs to the lower class category. And last class category, if the value of R is more than the value of the second λ, it is the upper class category.
